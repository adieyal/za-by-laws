                <p>PART 1</p>
                <p>GENERAL RULES REGARDING FEES FOR THE USE OF THE COUNCIL'S SEWERS AND SEWAGE PURIFICATION PLANT</p>
                <p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 6</p>
                <p>1. The fees determined by the Council accruing in respect of each -</p>
                <p>(a) half-year, becomes due and payable in advance on 1 July and 1 January of each year: Provided that the fees payable in terms of section 6 in respect of industrial effluent is payable half-yearly in arrears;</p>
                <p>(b) quarter, becomes due on the first day of such quarter and payable within six weeks after the first day of such quarter.</p>
                <p>2. If any fees determined by the Council in respect of any type of premises is based on the number of inmates, patients, servants, students, staff or other persons resident or occupying such premises, the Council may require a certificate specifying the number of persons occupying or accommodated on such premises during any particular period to be furnished to it by the person in charge of such premises.</p>
                <p>3. If any person who is required to furnish a return in terms of these By-laws, or this Schedule or to provide such other information as may be necessary to enable the Council to assess the amount payable in terms of a fee determined by the Council, fails to do so within 30 days after having been called upon to do so by notice in writing, he or she is liable to pay such fees as the Council may then assess on the best information available to it, subject to the Council's entitlement to levy any additional fees which may be applicable when further information becomes available.</p>
                <p>4. In all cases of dispute as to the date from which a fee becomes applicable, the decision of the Council is final.</p>
                <p>5. In the case of premises not connected to the municipal sewer the fees determined by the Council and contemplated in section 6 shall become payable with effect from the date on which the Council requires that a connection be made or with effect from the date when the premises are in fact connected, whichever is the earlier.</p>
                <p>6. The fees determined by the Council for domestic sewage, industrial effluents, swimming pools, fountains and reservoirs, remain effective in the case of buildings wholly unoccupied or in the course of demolition until the date on which the Council is requested to seal the openings to the Council 's sewer.</p>
                <p>7. If any change is made in the nature of the occupation or the use of any premises which requires the application of a different fee determined by the Council, no claim for any adjustment of an account rendered or any refund of monies paid in terms of these By-laws will be entertained by the Council unless notice in writing of the change is given to the Council within 30 days of the date of its occurrence.</p>
                <p>8.</p>
                <p>(a) The Council must designate the category of domestic sewage into which premises connected to the municipal sewer fall, for purposes of assessment of the amount payable in accordance with the fees determined by the Council; and</p>
                <p>(b) for the purpose of the designation referred to in this rule the Council may require the owner or occupier of any premises to furnish it with information to its satisfaction reflecting the number of dwelling-units on the premises.</p>
                <p>9. (1) The fees determined by Council for premises other than those referred to in rule 2 shall be assessed in advance for each quarter, and shall be based on a quantity equal to the water consumption metered in terms of Chapter 2, sections 30 to 35 of these By-laws, for the meter reading cycle of three months preceding the last meter reading prior to the quarter in question Provided that:</p>
                <p>(a) in the case of new premises or if the record of metered consumption on existing premises does not extend over the full meter reading cycle of three months or if, in the opinion of the Council , the record of metered consumption is not a suitable basis for the assessment of the fees by reason of a change in the occupation, use or ownership of premises, or special contingency, the fees for the coming quarter shall, subject to adjustment when the consumption of water for the three monthly period becomes available, be based on the Council estimate of the quantity of water to be consumed and discharged into the sewer on such premises during such coming three monthly period;</p>
                <p>(b) in the case of premises where the water consumed is not used solely for domestic purposes and in the absence of any direct measurement, the quantity of water discharged during a quarter shall be assessed by the Council according to the quantity of water consumed on the premises during that period, and in the assessment of that quantity deductions shall be made for the quantity lost during the process of trade or manufacture or present in the final product;</p>
                <p>(c) if the quantity of water obtained from a source other than the Council ’s water supply on the premises during that cycle is unknown, the fees shall be based on the Council estimate of the total water consumption on such premises during the aforesaid meter reading cycle.</p>
                <p>(d) Water consumption recorded by a meter installed in terms of -</p>
                <p>(i) section 86(8) shall be paid for on the basis of the fees determined by the Council for unspecified premises, or the fees determined by the Council for industrial effluent, if applicable, but not on the basis of both such fees;</p>
                <p>(ii) section 86(8)(b)shall not be subject to any fee;</p>
                <p>(iii) section 83(1)(c) shall not be subject to any fee for domestic effluent but subject to a fees for industrial effluent in terms of Part II, hereof.</p>
                <p>(2) If on any premises the Council, after consideration of its size, the number of water supply points and the complexity of the water reticulation, considers it impractical to determine the quantity of water discharged into the sewer from records of metered water consumption, it may in its discretion:</p>
                <p>(a) direct that water reticulation system be altered at the cost of the owner, to facilitate separate metering of water discharged into the sewer after use, and other water consumed, but not so discharged; or</p>
                <p>(b) assess the quantity of water discharged into the sewer in any six monthly meter reading period in accordance with the quantity of water used on the premises of a similar nature as determined by the Council.</p>
                <p>PART II</p>
                <p>GENERAL RULES REGARDING FEES FOR INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENT</p>
                <p>The following rules are applicable for the purposes of sections 80, 81 and 83 in connection with the fees determined by the Council which are payable for the acceptance, conveyance and treatment of industrial effluent discharged from any premises;</p>
                <p>1. The owner or occupier of premises on which any trade or industry is carried on and from which, as a result of such trade or industry or of any process incidental thereto, any effluent is discharged to the municipal sewer, shall, in addition to any other fees determined by the Council for which he or she may become liable, pay to the Council an industrial effluent fee including any minimum fee, which fees must be determined by the Council and must be calculated -</p>
                <p>(a) on the quantity of water discharged during the half-year forming the period of the fee; and</p>
                <p>(b) in accordance with the arithmetic mean of the results of the analyses, specified in item 3, of not less than eight grab samples of effluent taken at any time during a three month assessment period: Provided that the Council may in its discretion use another method of assessment if in its opinion it will lead to a fairer result.</p>
                <p>2. Whenever a sample is taken by the Council in terms of rule 1, one half thereof shall, on the request of the owner, occupier or person in control of the premises, be made available to him or her and like provisions shall apply to any samples taken by the owner, occupier or person in control in favour of the Council.</p>
                <p>3. The analyses referred to in rule 1 must be in accordance with the methods of chemical analysis normally used by the Council for the purpose and may include -</p>
                <p>Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)</p>
                <p>Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen</p>
                <p>Nitrate as N</p>
                <p>Ammonia as N</p>
                <p>Total phosphorus</p>
                <p>Orthophosphate as P</p>
                <p>pH</p>
                <p>Substances listed in Schedule C (Rule 5.9) and D:</p>
                <p>4. In the absence of any direct measurement, the quantity of industrial effluent discharged during half-year must be assessed by the Council according to the quantity of water consumed on the premises during that period, and in the assessment of that quantity a deduction must be made of the quantity used on the premises for domestic purposes, and the quantity lost to the atmosphere during the process of trade or manufacture, or present in the final product.</p>
                <p>a</p>
                <p>5. Unless the Council, in any particular case, agrees otherwise in writing with an owner or occupier,</p>
                <p>the fees determined by the Council for industrial effluent will be levied in respect of half-years beginning 1July and 1 January;</p>
                <p>Provided that -</p>
                <p>(i) if the last monthly reading relating to a half yearly charging period is taken before the end of that period, the remaining part of the period will be deemed to belong for charging purposes to the next succeeding half-yearly charging period;</p>
                <p>(ii) if the last monthly meter reading relating to the half-yearly charging period is taken after the end of that period, that part of the succeeding period which has elapsed when the reading is taken will be deemed to form part of the charging period to which the reading relates; and</p>
                <p>(iii) if the discharge of effluent to the sewer begins during a half-year as aforesaid the charge made in respect of that half-year must be calculated as from the relevant date.</p>
                <p>6. If a meter measuring the quantity of water consumed on premises is proved defective, an appropriate adjustment must be made to the quantity of industrial effluent discharged when calculated as provided by rule 4.</p>
                <p>7. (1) If industrial effluent is discharged into the sewer from more points than one, whether on the same floor or on different floors of premises, the Council may in its discretion for all purposes of assessing a fee for industrial effluent, including the taking of test samples, treat each such point of discharge as a separate point for the discharge of industrial effluent into the sewer.</p>
                <p>the</p>
                <p>(2) For the purpose of calculating, as prescribed in rule 4, the quantity of effluent discharged from each point of discharge as aforesaid, the total water consumed on the premises must be allocated as accurately as is reasonably practicable, after consultation between the Council and the occupier, among the several points of discharge</p>
                <p>8. If a grab sample taken at any time after the three month assessment period should reveal that the total pollutant load is altered in such a way as to place a heavier load on the Council 's sewage treatment plants, and the owner, occupier or person in control has failed to advise the Council in writing of the change, the owner or occupier will immediately become liable for twice the difference between the assessed fees and the fees that would have been levied had the total pollutant load been correctly assessed.</p>
                <p>9. If an inspection should reveal that the owner or occupier or person in control has failed to discharge industrial effluent during periods specified by the Council in accordance with section 86(6), the owner or occupier will immediately become liable for the full amount of the industrial effluent fees .</p>
                <p>10. (1)</p>
                <p>(a) The Council may, during any half yearly period referred to in rule 5, render a provisional account in respect of a part of such period, which part must as nearly as practically possible be a period of 30 days, and the amount of such account must be determined as provided in sub-rule (b) and the Council must as soon as possible after the end of such period render an account based on the actual measurements and results obtained in terms of rule 1(a) and (b) for such period, giving credit for any sum paid on a provisional account as aforesaid.</p>
                <p>(b) The amount of a provisional account referred to in sub-rule (a) must be determined by the Council by reference to such previous discharge on the same premises as would in its opinion, constitute a reasonable guide to the quantity of effluent discharged over the period covered by the provisional account by reference to such discharge on other similar premises which, in its opinion, affords reasonable guidance.</p>
                <p>(2) A provisional account rendered in terms of sub-rule (1) (a) is payable on the date stipulated therein.</p>
                <p>(3) An owner's decision to dispute an account shall not entitle him or her to defer payment beyond the due date stipulated in the account.</p>
                <p>PART 3</p>
                <p>GENERAL RULES REGARDING FEES FOR AN</p>
                <p>ON-SITE SANITATION SERVICE</p>
                <p>The following rules are applicable or the purposes of section 70 in connection with the fees determined by the Council which are payable for the provision of a sanitation service:</p>
                <p>1. A commencement fee as determined by the Council will be payable in respect of the provision of sanitation services before the commencement of such services.</p>
                <p>2. Night soil removal services may be provided on a tri-weekly, nightly or other basis at the discretion of the Council.</p>
                <p>3. The fees for night soil removal must be based on the number of pails and, for a vacuum tank removal, on the quantity removed.</p>
                <p>4. A tri-weekly night soil removal service may be provided to a bona fide builder during building operations.</p>
                <p>5. A mobile convenience may be provided at the discretion of the Council. 6. A vacuum tank removal service may be provided at the discretion of the Council. 7. Any sanitation service provided by the Council may be subject to an escalating tariff of fees within six months of the introduction of a suitable waterborne system. ---- oo000oo----</p>

                <p>NOTE: On premises where it is not possible to drain all sanitary fittings by gravitation to a connecting sewer, the Council will consider applications for lifting sewage in compliance with the requirements of the National Building Regulations made in terms of the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act, 1977, and any other applicable law only in respect of those parts of premises which cannot be drained by gravitation. In the case of single basements, consideration will be given to the use of sanitary fittings on the ground floor.</p>
                <p>In all cases where lifting of sewage is permitted, the Council will stipulate the rate of discharge, which will be normally limited to a maximum of 240 litres per minute.</p>
                <p>INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED BY OWNER</p>
                <p>The owner of the premises must furnish the following information and the relevant literature and characteristic curves, and sign the application and undertaking:</p>
                <p>(a) Make of appliance, name of supplier and purpose for which the appliance is designed;</p>
                <p>(b) kW rating and speed of motor;</p>
