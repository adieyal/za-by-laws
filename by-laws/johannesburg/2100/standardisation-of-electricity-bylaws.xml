      <p>The old Johannesburg Municipal Electricity By-laws used in the area supplied by the previous Johannesburg Electricity Department and the old Transvaal Provincial Electricity By-laws used throughout the remainder of the Greater Johannesburg area of supply, being the areas serviced by the Electricity Departments of the previous Randburg, Roodepoort, Enerdale and Lenasia South East Councils, are hereby substituted by the following standardised Electricity By-laws:</p>
