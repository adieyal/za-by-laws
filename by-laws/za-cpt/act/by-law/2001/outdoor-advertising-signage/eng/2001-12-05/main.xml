    <preamble>
      <p>To provide a set of regulations governing the use of land and buildings for outdoor advertising and signage and for matters incidental thereto.</p>
      <p>The object of this By-Law is to regulate outdoor advertising in the jurisdiction of the City of Cape Town in a manner that is sensitive to the environmental quality of different parts of the City of Cape Town. It seeks to strike a balance between outdoor advertising opportunities and economic development on the one hand, and the conservation of visual, tourist, traffic safety, environmental and heritage characteristics on the other hand. The object of this By—Law is to ensure that outdoor advertising respects the integrity of any site on which it is displayed, and complements the character of the locality in which it is displayed.</p>
      <p>The sensitivity of the proposed locality of a sign and its capacity to withstand the visual impact are the most important guiding principles for the control of outdoor advertising. Outdoor advertising signs should only be placed where they are most compatible with the surrounding locality and where they do not impact on visual corridors and/or scenic drives. Signs that compromise protected, unique or sensitive areas will not be allowed.</p>
      <p>In addition, outdoor advertising and signs should not compromise the functioning and safety of traffic and should not adversely affect the character of a locality by way of appearance, size or illumination.</p>
      <p>Advertising on bridges, towers, telecommunication masts or pylons will not be permitted.</p>
      <p>The types of landscapes, signs and areas of control are important factors in the classification concept utilized in this By-Law. This By-Law presumes that the type of sign gives an indication of the potential impact of such a sign on the locality in which it will be displayed. Thus in terms of this By-Law the local character of an area in which a sign is proposed will affect the degree of control applied in that area.</p>
      <p>This By-Law recognises that the dynamics between the type of the sign, the sign itself and where it is to be located can most effectively be dealt with by the determination of areas of control. Three areas of control are applied in this By-Law namely maximum, partial and minimum areas of control. The potential for outdoor advertising and the sign types to be considered is therefore determined by permitting certain sign types in certain areas of control. Control measures are applied by means of approval or refusal, and by means of general and specific conditions and requirements.</p>
      <p>The following signs are outdoor signs but which, without third party advertising, do not constitute outdoor advertising within the ambit of this By-Law:</p>
      <p>(i) Authorised tourist destination signs as defined by the Roads Traffic Manual</p>
      <p>(ii) Community information/educational boards</p>
      <p>(iii) Any sign required to be displayed by law including road traffic signs erected in terms of any Act of Parliament, Provincial Law or By-Law.</p>
      <p>Finally, this By-Law sets out the procedures to be followed and the criteria used when obtaining approval for a sign applicable to outdoor advertising in the City of Cape Town. In doing so, it recognises that there is an extensive amount of technical detail applicable to specific sign types and their effect in specific localities. The specific requirements for specific signs are set out in the Schedules hereto. The Schedules are part of the By-Law. These Schedules are not any less important than the content of the By-Law itself.</p>

              <content>
                <p>Subject to approval in terms of this By-Law, the erection and/or display of Locality Bound Freestanding signs and Composite signs are permitted only in Urban areas of maximum, partial and minimum control, and are permitted for the erection and/or display of Locality Bound Freestanding and Composite signs and locality bound farm signs and conservation facility signs in Natural and Rural Areas of Maximum Control. In addition:</p>
                <p>1. Locality bound freestanding signs and freestanding composite signs shall only be permitted in the following instances:</p>
                <p>1.1 Where business premises, farm buildings or conservation facility buildings are set back 15 m or more from the boundary of the road reserve; or</p>
                <p>1.2 Where it is not reasonably possible to affix appropriate signs to a building; or</p>
                <p>1.3 Where such a sign is necessary to allow the public to locate the entrance to business premises, farm buildings or conservation facility buildings; or</p>
                <p>1.4 Where the existence of a freestanding composite sign may prevent the proliferation of signs.</p>
                <p>1.5 In the case of farm signs and conservation facility signs: </p>
                <p>(i) Entrance gates, gate structures, or boundary walls may be considered for the display of first party banners or flags, or for having sign panels attached to, placed against, or painted on, as a means of display;</p>
                <p>(ii) Custom made signage on devices such as wine barrels and farm implements will be permitted.</p>
                <p>2. Locality Bound freestanding and composite signs may not exceed 7,5 m in height and in addition may not exceed 4,5 m² in total area. This provision may be waived to a maximum height of 10 m and a maximum total area of 15 m² per side, having regard to the following factors:</p>
                <p>2.1 If such increase reduces the number of individual signs facing any one street boundary of the site, thereby minimising the visual impact on the surrounding environment;</p>
                <p>2.2 If more than 2 significant roads approach the site in question;</p>
                <p>2.3 The number of businesses, farm activities or conservation facility activities which will be advertising on such sign;</p>
                <p>2.4 The number of approach/exit routes to the site in question;</p>
                <p>2.5 The applicable zoning of the area surrounding the site in question. A surrounding residential zone will not accommodate the same size of sign as will a surrounding commercial/industrial zone.</p>
                <p>3. Service Station free standing signs must be locality-bound and may only be erected or displayed at service stations adjacent to and directly accessible from the public road at which such a sign is directed and only one Service Station free standing facility sign per street boundary shall be permitted. This provision may be waived only where these signs are visible from national class 1 routes (N1, N2 and N7).</p>
                <p>4. Service station free standing signs shall not exceed 7,5 m in height and shall not consist of more than 8 advertising panels of 4,5 m² each in total area. The provisions of this section may be waived to a maximum height of 16 m and 8 advertising panels not exceeding 6 m² each in total area having regard to the factors mentioned in section 2 above.</p>

              <content>
                <p>Subject to approval in terms of this By-law, the erection and/or display of loose portable signs is permitted in areas of minimum and partial control as well as designated areas within urban areas of maximum control. In addition:</p>
                <p>1. Loose portable signs placed in the Road Reserve or in Public Open Space without the written permission of the Municipality are not permitted in terms of the By-Law.</p>
                <p>2. The Municipality may summarily remove those loose portable signs placed without the Municipality’s permission in the Road Reserve or Municipality-owned property. The Municipality will impound these signs. Owners can recover their property on payment of R100,-00 to the Municipality which will be used to defray the cost of removal, storage and transportation.</p>
                <p>3. The Municipality will consider applications to permit the placement, within the Road Reserve or on Municipality owned property of certain loose portable signs which comply with the following requirements:</p>
                <p>3.1 The loose portable sign does not pose a hazard in terms of safety to the public and is, in this regard, of appropriate structure and size.</p>
                <p>3.2 The loose portable sign does not obstruct or inconvenience the public either by its physical size or location.</p>
                <p>3.3 The loose portable sign does not unfairly prejudice other traders.</p>
                <p>3.4 The loose portable sign, or proposed number thereof does not detract from the amenity of the local streetscape or local environment.</p>
                <p>3.5 The loose portable sign is solely to advertise the name of the business, goods and/or services for sale from the advertiser’s premises.</p>
                <p>3.6 The maximum dimensions of the proposed loose portable sign shall be 1,20 m (height) x 0,6 m (width).</p>
                <p>3.7 The loose portable sign shall be placed directly in front of the advertisers’ premises, provided that the above criteria are met.</p>
                <p>3.8 A minimum clear footway width of 1,2 m adjacent to the sign must remain clear.</p>
                <p>4. Approved loose portable signs will be allocated to a demarcated area within the Road Reserve or on Municipal property where, during the normal trading hours, applicants may then place the approved loose portable sign. The said loose portable sign must be removed outside normal trading hours and stored away from public view.</p>
                <p>5. The demarcated area for displaying the loose portable signs, will be leased to an applicant at a rate to be set by the Municipality and published in accordance with a Schedule of tariffs and charges to be updated annually by the Municipality, payable in advance for a maximum period of six months.</p>
                <p>6. Applicants will be required to indemnify the Municipality against any claims for third parties that may arise, due to the placement of loose portable signs within the Road Reserve or on municipal property and shall take out third party insurance.</p>
                <p>7. Notwithstanding the above the Municipality may cause the removal or impoundment of the Loose Portable sign/s should the applicant contravene any of the above conditions.</p>
                <p>8. The fees set out herein may be updated annually by the Municipality and in accordance with a published schedule of tariffs and charges.</p>

            <heading>Signs on municipal land/buildings</heading>
            <section id="schedule-16.section-0">
              <content>
                <p>Other than as is set out hereinbelow, no signs other than locality bound signs, temporary signs including loose portable sign, estate agents signs, newspaper headline posters and posters shall be erected on Municipal owned land. The erection of such signs shall be subject to approval in terms of this By-law, and compliance with any other Schedule and other rules applicable to the type of sign applied for.</p>
                <p>A. COMMERCIALLY SPONSORED SIGNS, OTHER THAN THOSE REFERRED TO IN SECTION 62</p>
                <p>1. Notwithstanding the area of control within which it is proposed to erect a commercially sponsored sign on municipal land, and subject to compliance with all other provisions of this By-Law, the Municipality may consider a commercially sponsored sign for approval, subject to the following:</p>
                <p>1.1 Public or community needs or goals shall be identified by the Municipality and/or adopted by it and if such needs can be addressed either entirely or in part by the granting of concessions to particular persons for the erection of commercially sponsored signs, the Municipality shall be entitled to call for proposals or counter proposals for such public or community needs or goals and the related advertising opportunities.</p>
                <p>1.2 In order to identify such public or community needs or goals, the relevant Municipal department and other interested authorities will be consulted prior to proposals being invited, so as to establish conditions, criteria and constraints in respect of such advertising.</p>
                <p>1.3 The Procurement Policy will be applied and the extent of involvement of previous disadvantaged persons, small businesses, job creation and empowerment will be considered in any proposal.</p>
                <p>1.4 Any proposal will be evaluated based on the requirements of the By-Law and inter alia on the best public or community benefit offered, the design contribution, the creativity and public safety and the adherence to the principals and/or stipulations in the By-Law as opposed to the largest advertising opportunity and/or financial gain. In addition, the permanence of the contribution to the public or community goal or need will be taken into account, as will the recovery cost over the period of the erection of the sign. When contributions in kind are to be recovered by the Municipality, a conversion of this to a monetary contribution to the Municipality’s income base will be assessed.</p>
                <p>1.5 The relevant municipal departments, municipal property branch and the environmental management branch as well as the transport and roads branch (in the case of advertising within the road reserve) shall jointly evaluate the proposal and approval will be given when such evaluation process is complete.</p>
                <p>1.6 The Municipality, as landowner, reserves the right not to proceed with any proposal prior to final approval thereof and the call for invitations for proposals in any respect shall not be regarded as decision by the Municipality to proceed with the erection of a sign in respect of a specific site.</p>
                <p>1.7 Once accepted, any sign to be erected in terms of this schedule must be the subject matter of a written agreement between the Municipality as landowner and the person responsible for the erection of the sign which agreement will contain the rights and obligations of both parties but which will not derogate from any of the obligations on either party in terms of this By-Law. No sign may be erected or displayed in terms of this schedule until such agreement has been concluded and a signed copy delivered to the environmental management branch of the Municipality.</p>
                <p>B. SPONSORED SIGNS</p>
                <p>2. Notwithstanding the area of control within which it is proposed to erect such a sign on Municipal owned land and subject to compliance with all other provisions of the By-Law, the Municipality may consider a sponsored sign for approval on condition that:</p>
                <p>2.1 In the application to be submitted in terms of Section 2 of this By-Law, written details are delivered clearly indicating the recognised public or community goal which will be promoted by the erection and/or display of the proposed sign.</p>
                <p>2.2 Signs with a political content will not be permitted.</p>
                <p>2.3 No more than 5% of the total surface of the sign is used for third party advertising.</p>
                <p>2.4 The maximum size of any such sign is 6 m x 3 m provided in the event of a V-shaped sign being proposed, its maximum size will not exceed two panels of 6 m x 3 m each.</p>
                <p>2.5 Applications for billboards to be erected in terms of this section must comply with the requirements as set out in Schedule 2.</p>
                <p>2.6 No sign erected in terms of this clause shall be located within 5 m of a property’s boundary lines.</p>
                <p>C. NON-PROFIT SIGNS</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the area of control within which it is proposed to erect a sign, and subject to compliance with all other provisions of this By-Law,</p>
                <p>the Municipality may consider the erection of a sign by or for the benefit of a non-profit body subject to compliance with the requirements set out in Schedule 17 hereto.</p>

                <p>1. Notwithstanding the area of control within which it is proposed to erect a sign by or for the benefit of a non-profit body, and subject to compliance with all other provisions of this By-Law, the Municipality may consider such a sign for approval subject to the following:</p>
                <p>1.1 In the application to be submitted in terms of Section 2 of this By-Law, written details from the host non-profit body regarding the nature and extent of the support to be received from the erection or display of the sign must be delivered to the Municipality together with the other information set out in Section 2 of the By-Law.</p>
                <p>1.2 The extent of involvement of previous disadvantaged communities, small businesses, job creation and empowerment will be considered in any proposal.</p>
                <p>1.3 Any proposal will be evaluated based on the requirements of the By-Law and the public or community goal benefit which is being met, the design contribution, the creativity and public safety and the adherence to the principals and/or stipulations in the By-Law as opposed to the largest advertising opportunity and/or financial gain. In addition, the permanence of the contribution to the goal of the non-profit body will be taken into account.</p>
                <p>1.4 In the event of it being proposed that the said sign will be erected on municipal land:</p>
