      <p>AND WHEREAS Part B of Schedule 4 to the Constitution lists building regulations as a local government matter to the extent set out in section 155(6) (a) and (7);</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS the City of Cape Town seeks to identify, control and manage dilapidated and problem buildings within its area of jurisdiction to ensure that such buildings comply with this By-law by—</p>

      <p>— Turning problem buildings around by rejuvenating and regenerating the buildings rather than demolishing them;</p>
      <p>— Redeveloping the property where problem buildings can’t be rejuvenated or regenerated after consultation with the owners;</p>
      <p>— Facilitating the disposal of problem buildings for the purpose of achieving the objectives of this By-law.</p>
