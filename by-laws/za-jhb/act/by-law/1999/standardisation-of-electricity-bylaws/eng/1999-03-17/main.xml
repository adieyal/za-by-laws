      <p>It is hereby notified in terms of Section 101 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1939, that the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council have adopted a uniform set of Electricity By-laws for the entire Metropolitan area served by Metropolitan Electricity. Areas serviced by Eskom are not subject to these By-laws but to that organisation's rules and provision of electricity supply.</p>
      <p>The old Johannesburg Municipal Electricity By-laws used in the area supplied by the previous Johannesburg Electricity Department and the old Transvaal Provincial Electricity By-laws used throughout the remainder of the Greater Johannesburg area of supply, being the areas serviced by the Electricity Departments of the previous Randburg, Roodepoort, Enerdale and Lenasia South East Councils, are hereby substituted by the following standardised Electricity By-laws:</p>
