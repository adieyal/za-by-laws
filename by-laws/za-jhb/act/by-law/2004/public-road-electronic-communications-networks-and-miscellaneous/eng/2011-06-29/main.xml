              <content>
                <p>FOREWORD</p>
                <p>Although the road authority is solely responsible for its own road network, the value of other r services in the road reserve are often more than that of the road itself and therefore require as much or more maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement. These activities, together with the work that has to be carried out on the road itself, result in considerable delays, inconvenience, danger and additional costs to the road users. Furthermore, any work which is done in the road reserve can have serious cost implications as a result of any of the following:</p>
                <p>damage to roads and other services; damage to vehicles; injury to vehicle occupants or pedestrians; reduction of the effective life of the road, footway or other services; and time and social costs caused by delays.</p>
                <p>There is therefore a need to ensure careful control and co-ordination of all work in the road reserve. This is the duty of the road authority who is the custodian of all municipal road reserves. In order to fulfil this duty, the road authority produced this document that attempts to ensure maximum co-ordination and co-operation between all the various departments and agencies that have to share the road reserve to provide Services to their customers.</p>
                <p>It is the aim of this document to minimise the effect of all work in the road reserve to the benefit of all concerned, and in particular the ratepayers, road users (motorists and pedestrians), service agencies and the road authority. Included are the procedures to apply, process and approve wayleaves, procedures to follow while doing the work and on completion of the work as well as specifications according to which the work must be done.</p>
                <p>This initiative can only succeed if every agency and department that works in the road reserve co-operate by working according to this Code and by providing feedback on how the system can be improved.</p>

For every day that work is done after normal working hours and the Jane is fully opened for all the normal working hours of the following day, the Jane rental will only be 10% of TDC.</p>

                  <p>Method A. Re-using excavated material</p>
                  <p>During excavation of the trench, the material from the top 400 mm of the excavation (or in the case of arterials, collectors and industrial roads, the top 550 mm) must be stockpiled separately from the rest of the material being excavated. This material must then be improved through chemical stabilisation with cement and used for the base and subbase layers during backfilling, and in the case of arterials, collectors and industrial roads also for the selected subgrade layers.</p>
                  <p>The requirements for this method is given in Figure 1 following on section 13.8.7.</p>
                  <p>If the material is not stockpiled separately during excavation, the road authority will require that material with the required properties be imported. Material which was originally stabilised cannot be re-used and must be discarded.</p>

                  <p>Import a G5 gravel material and stabilise with 60 kg of cement per m3 of material. Water must be uniformly mixed into the material. The material must then be placed in the trench in 75 to 100 mm layers and compacted to the required Mod. AASHTO densities as specified in Figure 1 to the Code. The final layer must be finished to a level of 100 mm below the level of the surrounding sound surface of the road.</p>

                  <p>ANNEXURE A</p>
                  <p>SUMMARY OF CONDITIONS FOR WORK IN THE ROAD RESERVE</p>
                  <p>This page is intended to provide a summary of conditions and specifications. Please refer to City of Johannesburg Municipality's Code of Practice for Work in the Road Reserve for more detail.</p>
                  <p>Before any work is done in the road reserve, a wayleave must be issued by the roads authority wayleaves office. This will only be done after a completed wayleave application form has been received by the wayleave officer and the reinstatement fee paid. Before submitting the form to the Wayleave Officer, approval must be obtained from all other agencies indicated on the form.</p>
                  <p>In the case of emergency work, e.g. burst pipes, a wayleave application form must be submitted within 24 hours and the road authority maintenance depot must be informed.</p>
                  <p>All work must be done according to the aforesaid Code of Practice. Only work indicated. on the wayleave form may be done and only during the period indicated, unless approval has been obtained from the relevant wayleave office to change the dates.</p>
                  <p>The wayleave holder is responsible for all costs, including any damage to another service, backfilling, reinstatement, tests and any claim that may result. The wayleave holder is also responsible for traffic signs, barricading and the safety of motorists, pedestrians and workers.</p>
                  <p>If any trees or road furniture are affected by the proposed work, then the relevant office must be contacted.</p>
                  <p>Any underground service must not have less than 800 mm cover and all manhole or valve covers must be finished flush with the surface of the road or the verge.</p>
                  <p>Backfilling and reinstatement: Backfilling must be done according to the specifications given in the aforesaid Code of Practice. The minimum requirement is that the backfilled layers must have at least the same shear strengths as those of the adjacent undisturbed pavement layers. The tests done with a DCP or a RCCD will either be done by the road authority or a copy of the results handed into the issuing wayleave office. The reinstatement (1 00 mm asphalt layer} of the surface will be done by the road authority unless specific permission is granted to the wayleave holder to do the work.</p>
                  <p>The wayleave holder is responsible for obtaining the required strengths, but the following is recommended as a method that should be adequate in most cases.</p>
                  <p>The wayleave holder must ensure that the top 400 mm (550 mm for arterials, collectors and industrial streets}, be stockpiled separately and stabilised with 4 % Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC} approximately 80 kg/m 3 of cement. The material must be</p>
                  <p>. compacted in thin (75 to 100 mm} layers with a vibratory compactor at optimum moisture content (OMC} to the required densities (base: 98 %, subbase: 95 %, selected subgrade: 93 % and subgrade: 90 % Mod AASHTO} to within 100 mm of the existing road surface. This method should provide the required shear strengths is most cases, but it should be noted that material that was originally stabilised cannot be re-used and must be discarded.</p>
                  <p>The reinstatement of the surfacing must consist of 100 mm hot-mix asphalt. The lower 70 mm must be "blackbase" (26,5 mm nominal stone size, continuously graded) and the top 30 mm fine (4, 75 mm nominal stone size, continuously graded hot mix). Cold mix may only be used for temporary backfills (Emergency backfill).</p>
                  <p>If desired the wayleaves holder may place foamed concrete of a mrmmum 4 MPa crushed strength and manufactured to an approved manufacturers specification. The foamed concrete is to be placed to level 100 mm below the surrounding surface level. As soon as the foamed concrete has set sufficiently, a 70 mm layer of asphalt basecourse material must be placed on top followed by a 30 mm layer of continuously graded asphalt wearing course material.</p>
                  <p>The top 100 mm of a trench must be backfilled by the wayleave holder, compacted and maintained in a serviceable condition for a period of 14 days commencing on the day after the date of issue of the certificate of completion.</p>
                  <p>Constructed footways must be reinstated with the original surfacing materials and the supporting layers compacted to obtain shear strengths at least equal to those of the adjacent undisturbed footway.</p>
                  <p>Un-constructed verges must be backfilled in such a way that the verge is in the same condition as it was before excavation.</p>
                  <p>After completion of any work in the road reserve, the site must be cleared and cleaned and all excess material, tools and equipment must be removed.</p>
                  <p>The wayleave form, or a copy thereof, must be returned to the wayleave officer within 24 hours after completion of the work with the completion notice and signed by all parties and must be accompanied by the DCP or RCCD test results.</p>
                  <p>Any excavation left unattended for a period of more than 5 days, will be made safe by the road authority and charged to the service agency or contractor, who made the excavation.</p>
